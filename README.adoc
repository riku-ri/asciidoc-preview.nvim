== {gr}

This is a previewer for asciidoc format.

I moved from markdown to asciidoc currently,
it is mainly because:

- markdown has no variable
- markdown use tail space to break line

{gr} is based on {preview_nvim}.
{preview_nvim} is a preview template for neovim.
{preview_nvim} contain some non-documentation file type,
like graphviz dot, R.

These file type may make a huge different between the source code and the products.
So auto scroll should not apply to them.

But I'm going to add the auto scroll feature for asciidoc.
